# TUTORS Simulator APP

Tutors Simulator App is the back-end simulator interface for this project that was built as part of the tutos Live simulator presence engine feature (with the front-end being Tutors Hive) . This is writing data such as names, topic studying, images and slack links to the Tutors Simulator Realtime Database. This project is linked to the repo [Tutors Prototype App](https://github.com/GracieHub/tutors-prototype-app) which is reading student data from Tutors Simulator Realtime database and displaying the students in categories based on the topic covered, (as well as an additonal message and call feature).
